# LTN Tracker

Adds a GUI to display information about your [LTN](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/LogisticTrainNetwork) network.

### LTN Tracker displays:
1. Depot stops, their current status and assigned trains.
2. Stations with provided/requested items, current deliveries and their control signals.
3. The combined inventory of all stations, with detailed information for each item.
4. A history of recent deliveries.
5. Alerts for stations and trains.

The GUI can be switched on and off using a toggle button in the top left corner or a configurable hotkey.

Special thanks to Optera for creating LTN and for his continued support during the development of this mod.

And finally a small warning: While this mod was tested by Optera and myself, it is still the initial release of my first Factorio mod. Bugs are to be expected.
